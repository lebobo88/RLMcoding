# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Copilot Instructions (RLM v2.7)

## Project Overview
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Methodology
This project follows the RLM (Research-Lead-Manage) methodology:
- **Start here**: Read `RLM/START-HERE.md` for workflow overview
- **Prompts**: Use prompts in `RLM/prompts/` for each workflow step
- **Specs**: Read specs from `RLM/specs/` before implementing any feature
- **TDD**: Write failing tests first, then implementation (5-step process)
- **Tasks**: Reference task files in `RLM/tasks/active/` for requirements
- **Standards**: Follow standards defined in `RLM/specs/constitution.md`
- **Progress**: Update `RLM/progress/status.json` after completing tasks

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Readability over cleverness
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

### Naming Conventions
| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Variables | camelCase | `userName`, `isActive` |
| Functions | camelCase | `getUserById`, `calculateTotal` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `UserService`, `OrderProcessor` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` |
| Files (components) | PascalCase | `UserProfile.tsx` |
| Files (utilities) | kebab-case | `date-utils.ts` |

### Code Quality
- Functions < 50 lines
- 80%+ test coverage target
- TypeScript strict mode
- Document all public APIs

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: `[filename].test.ts`
- Integration tests: `[filename].integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `[filename].e2e.test.ts` (for feature verification)
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Run tests before marking task complete

## TDD 5-Step Process
1. **Load Context** (0-20%): Read task spec, feature spec, constitution
2. **Write Tests** (20-40%): TDD Red - write failing tests first
3. **Implement** (40-70%): TDD Green - write code to pass tests
4. **Verify** (70-85%): Run tests, fix failures, check coverage
5. **Review** (85-100%): Quality checks, update status, move task to completed

## File Structure
| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `RLM/START-HERE.md` | Entry point - read this first |
| `RLM/prompts/` | Workflow prompts (01-08) |
| `RLM/specs/PRD.md` | Product Requirements Document |
| `RLM/specs/constitution.md` | Project standards |
| `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/` | Feature specifications |
| `RLM/specs/architecture/` | Technical architecture |
| `RLM/specs/design/` | Design system (UI projects) |
| `RLM/tasks/active/` | Tasks to implement |
| `RLM/tasks/completed/` | Finished tasks |
| `RLM/progress/status.json` | Current project state |

## Git Workflow
- Branch: `feature/TASK-XXX-brief-description`
- Commits: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`)
- Reference specs in commits (e.g., "feat: Implements FTR-001")
- Always link to task ID in commit/PR
