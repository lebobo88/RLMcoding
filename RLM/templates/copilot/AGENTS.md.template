# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Agent Instructions (RLM v2.7)

This project uses the RLM methodology for AI-assisted development.

## Before You Start

1. **Read Overview**: Start with `RLM/START-HERE.md` for workflow overview
2. **Read the Task**: Check `RLM/tasks/active/TASK-XXX.md` for requirements
3. **Read the Spec**: Find feature spec in `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/`
4. **Check Constitution**: Follow standards in `RLM/specs/constitution.md`
5. **Use Prompts**: Reference `RLM/prompts/` for workflow guidance

## TDD 5-Step Process (Required)

Always follow this sequence:

1. **Load Context** (0-20%): Read task spec, feature spec, constitution
2. **Write Tests** (20-40%): TDD Red - write failing tests first
3. **Implement** (40-70%): TDD Green - write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Verify** (70-85%): Run tests, fix failures, check coverage
5. **Review** (85-100%): Quality checks, update status, move task to completed

## Task Completion Checklist

Before marking a task complete:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from task file met
- [ ] Tests written and passing (80%+ coverage target)
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Code follows constitution standards
- [ ] Update `RLM/progress/status.json`
- [ ] Move task to `RLM/tasks/completed/`
- [ ] PR description references TASK-XXX
