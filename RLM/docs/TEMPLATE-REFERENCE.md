## PRD-TEMPLATE.md

### Purpose
Comprehensive Product Requirements Document template with 13 sections covering all aspects of a product.

### When to Use
- Generated automatically by `/discover`
- Use manually when writing a PRD from scratch
- Reference when ensuring PRD completeness

### Key Sections

| Section | Purpose | Critical For |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| 1. Executive Summary | Quick overview | Stakeholder alignment |
| 2. Problem Statement | What we're solving | Validation |
| 3. User Personas | Who we're building for | UX decisions |
| 4. User Stories | What users need to do | Requirements |
| 5. Functional Requirements | Feature list | Scope |
| 6. Non-Functional Requirements | Quality attributes | Architecture |
| 7. Technical Constraints | Limitations | Tech decisions |
| 8. Success Metrics | How to measure success | Validation |
| 9. Scope Definition | MVP vs future | Prioritization |
| 10. Risk Assessment | What could go wrong | Planning |
| 11. Timeline | When | Planning |
| 12. Open Questions | Unknowns | Clarification |
| 13. Appendices | Reference material | Documentation |

### Tips
- Fill Section 3 (Personas) carefully - they guide user stories
- Be specific in Section 5 (Functional Requirements) - vague requirements = vague implementation
- Section 9 (Scope) is critical - clearly separate MVP from future

## Creating Custom Templates

To create a custom template:

1. Create file in `RLM/templates/`
2. Include clear section headers
3. Use placeholders like `[Description]`
4. Add example content where helpful
5. Include usage instructions at top

### Example Custom Template

```markdown
# [Template Name]

**Purpose**: [What this template is for]
**When to Use**: [When to use it]

---

## Section 1: [Name]

[Description of what goes here]

Example:
[Example content]

## Section 2: [Name]

[Description]

---

**Template Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: [Date]
```

---

## Template Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Vague templates produce vague documents
2. **Include Examples**: Show what good looks like
3. **Use Checkboxes**: For items that need verification
4. **Add Context**: Explain WHY sections exist
5. **Keep Updated**: Templates should evolve with your process
