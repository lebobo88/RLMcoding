## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Locate RLM
Ensure you have the `RLM/` folder in your project with:
- `RLM/prompts/` - Workflow prompts
- `RLM/templates/` - Document templates
- `RLM/specs/` - Your specifications (generated)
- `RLM/tasks/` - Your tasks (generated)
- `RLM/progress/` - Progress tracking

### Step 2: Start Discovery
Tell your AI:
```
Read RLM/prompts/01-DISCOVER.md and help me discover specs for:
[Your project idea here]
```

Or in Claude Code:
```
/discover [Your project idea]
```

### Step 3: Answer Questions
The AI will ask ~12-18 questions in 3-4 rounds, including design preferences for UI projects.

### Step 4: Review & Implement
- Review generated PRD at `RLM/specs/PRD.md`
- Generate specs: `/create-specs` or read `02-CREATE-SPECS.md`
- Create tasks: `/create-tasks` or read `03-CREATE-TASKS.md`
- Implement: `/implement all` or read `05-IMPLEMENT-ALL.md`

### Two Entry Points

**Path 1: Starting from Zero**
You have an idea but no documentation.
```
/cc-full [idea]           # Complete 9-phase automation
OR
/discover [idea]          # Step-by-step approach
```

**Path 2: Starting from PRD**
You already have a Product Requirements Document.
```
/cc-full --from-prd       # Start from Phase 2
OR
/create-specs             # Step-by-step approach
```

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Discovery (`01-DISCOVER.md`)

**Purpose**: Transform idea into PRD

**Process**:
1. Checks for existing research in `RLM/research/project/`
2. AI researches competitors and best practices
3. Answer 3-4 rounds of clarifying questions:
   - Round 1: Business goals, users, MVP scope, success metrics
   - Round 2: Scale, integrations, tech constraints, data requirements
   - Round 3: Authentication, platforms, compliance, UX
   - Round 4 (UI): Design philosophy, animation tier, framework
4. AI generates comprehensive PRD

**Auto-Detection Features**:
- Project research folder is automatically detected
- UI vs Non-UI classification determines if design phases run
- Previous outputs are prioritized to avoid redundant questions

**Output**: `RLM/specs/PRD.md`, `RLM/specs/constitution.md`

### Phase 2: Design System (UI Projects)

**Purpose**: Create design foundation

**Process**:
1. AI reads PRD for brand personality
2. Generates design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Creates component library specification
4. Defines animation guidelines

**Output**: `RLM/specs/design/design-system.md`, `RLM/specs/design/tokens/`

### Phase 3: Specifications (`02-CREATE-SPECS.md`)

**Purpose**: Create technical specifications

**Process**:
1. AI reads your PRD
2. Auto-detects if UI project (DESIGN_REQUIRED flag)
3. Creates detailed feature specifications
4. Designs system architecture
5. Creates epic breakdown with sprint planning

**Output**:
- `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/spec.md` - Feature specs
- `RLM/specs/architecture/overview.md` - Architecture
- `RLM/specs/epics/breakdown.md` - Sprint plan

### Phase 4: Feature Design (UI Projects)

**Purpose**: Create UI/UX specifications per feature

**Process**:
1. AI reads feature spec
2. Designs user flows and screen layouts
3. Specifies component usage
4. Defines responsive behavior

**Output**: `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/design-spec.md`

### Phase 5: Task Creation (`03-CREATE-TASKS.md`)

**Purpose**: Break features into implementable tasks

**Process**:
1. Loads checkpoint to detect existing tasks
2. AI reads all feature specs
3. Creates fine-grained tasks (1-4 hours each) for NEW features only
4. Determines dependencies and order
5. Updates checkpoint with new generation

**Checkpoint System**:
- Tasks include `generation` field
- Never overwrites existing tasks
- Run `/create-tasks` multiple times safely

**Output**: `RLM/tasks/active/TASK-XXX.md`, `RLM/tasks/INDEX.md`, `RLM/progress/checkpoint.json`

### Phase 6: Implementation (`04-IMPLEMENT-TASK.md`)

**Purpose**: Implement tasks using TDD

**Process**:
1. Select automation level (AUTO/SUPERVISED/MANUAL)
2. AI loads task and context
3. 5-Step TDD cycle with progress reporting:
   - Step 1: Load specs and context (0-20%)
   - Step 2: Write tests - TDD Red (20-40%)
   - Step 3: Implement code - TDD Green (40-70%)
   - Step 4: Run tests and fix (70-85%)
   - Step 5: Quality checks and review (85-100%)
4. Integrated review checklist per task
5. Mark task complete

**Real-Time Progress**:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 TASK-003: Implement user authentication         [3/8 tasks]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Progress: [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 40% (Step 2/5: Writing tests)

Token Usage This Task:
  Input:  2,450 tokens | Output: 1,230 tokens | Total: 3,680

Session Total: 15,420 / 100,000 tokens (15.4%)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Output**: Source code, tests, progress logs

### Phase 7: Quality

**Purpose**: Combined quality checks

**Components**:
- Design QA: 117-point checklist (if UI)
- Code Review: Security, patterns, compliance
- Test Coverage: Unit, integration, component tests

**Pass Criteria**: Design QA ≥90%, all tests pass, no security issues

### Phase 8: Verification

**Purpose**: E2E testing per feature

**Process**:
1. Auto-triggered when all feature tasks complete
2. Generates Playwright tests from acceptance criteria
3. Runs functional tests
4. Runs accessibility tests (axe-core, WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. Creates bug tasks if failures
6. Marks feature as verified when passing

**Feature Lifecycle**:
```
in_progress → verification-pending → verified
                      ↓
              verification-failed
                      ↓
              (fix bugs, re-verify)
```

### Phase 9: Report

**Purpose**: Generate project summary

**Includes**: Features implemented, test coverage, token usage, quality metrics

## Automation Levels

Choose your level of AI autonomy during implementation:

| Level | AI Behavior | Pauses At | Best For |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **AUTO** | Full autonomy | Blockers only | Simple tasks, overnight runs |
| **SUPERVISED** | Guided with checkpoints | Key decisions, after each task | Most development work |
| **MANUAL** | Step-by-step approval | Every action | Complex decisions, learning |

Use slash commands directly:
```bash
# Standard Commands
/discover Build a habit tracking app
/create-specs
/create-tasks
/implement TASK-001
/implement all
/implement resume

# Enhanced Commands (v2.6)
/cc-full Build a habit tracking app    # Complete 9-phase automation
/cc-full --from-prd                    # Start from existing PRD
/cc-debug                              # Diagnose and fix state issues
/cc-debug quick                        # Fast scan for common issues
/rlm-full [idea]                       # Standard prompt pipeline
```

### Cursor

Copy prompts into chat or tell the AI:
```
Read RLM/prompts/01-DISCOVER.md and help me discover specs for:
Build a habit tracking app with social features
```

### VS Code with Copilot

Use @workspace to give context:
```
@workspace Read RLM/prompts/01-DISCOVER.md and help me discover specs for:

```

---

## Progress Tracking

### Automatic Tracking

RLM automatically tracks:
- Task status in `RLM/progress/status.json`
- Checkpoint state in `RLM/progress/checkpoint.json`
- Token usage in `RLM/progress/token-usage/`
- Session logs in `RLM/progress/logs/`

### Context Window Management

RLM manages context automatically:
- **50% threshold**: Save checkpoint, log warning, continue
- **75% threshold**: Save checkpoint, suggest wrapping up
- **90% threshold**: Save checkpoint, complete current task only, pause

### Resuming Work

If you stop mid-implementation:
```
/implement resume
```
Or read `RLM/prompts/06-RESUME.md`

---

## Debug & Reconciliation

Use the debug command to diagnose and fix state issues:

```bash
/cc-debug              # Full diagnostic scan
/cc-debug quick        # Fast scan (common issues)
/cc-debug --auto-fix   # Auto-fix safe issues
```

**Issues Detected**:
- Orphan tasks (no parent feature)
- Missing tasks (incomplete feature coverage)
- Status mismatches (file vs status.json)
- Checkpoint drift
- Broken dependencies
- Duplicate IDs

---

## Project Research

Place research documents in `RLM/research/project/` to auto-populate PRD sections:

```
RLM/research/project/
├── competitor-analysis.md
├── market-research.md
├── user-interviews.md
├── technical-research.md
└── requirements-notes.md
```

The discovery phase automatically detects and uses this research.

## Best Practices

### During Discovery
- Be specific about your idea - more detail = better PRD
- Place existing research in `RLM/research/project/`
- Answer questions thoughtfully - they shape the architecture

### During Implementation
- Start with SUPERVISED mode until familiar
- Review generated code before moving on
- Use the integrated review checklist
- Don't skip the TDD process

### General Tips
- Keep tasks small (1-4 hours)
- Complete one task before starting another
- Run `/cc-debug quick` periodically
- Review the constitution when unsure about standards
